  Summarize the observations you recorded about the environment, people, objects, and interactions of daily life at Horace Mann. Note the different potential users that you observed and the behaviors/interactions that you witnessed. Make sure to describe the broader context of both the environment and the individual users themselves.
Analyze the observations and notes you described in your response to number 1 to formulate insights, questions, and theories about the environment and users that you observed. Use a framework such as AEIOU, or simply form associations by clustering different observations in groups based on categories that you define. This AEIOU worksheet may also be helpful.
Describe your process in finding these answers. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didnâ€™t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. Feel free to attach images, screenshots, etc to elaborate on your response.
