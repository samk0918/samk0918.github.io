## Good vs. Bad Design

### Good Design
An example of good design is the Google Classroom website. Google Classroom is well designed because it gives good feedback. In the instant between when you click on a class and the class pages loads, there is a little bar at the top of the screen that fills up as the class loads so you know that the class is loading and the website has registered your request. Additionally, the discoverability of Google Classroom is excellent since it is easy to click on things and figure out the different tools available to you. Of course, some of the design of Google Classroom is up to the teacher, and that modification is another element of its good design. The option to put something as a material or an assignment is another helpful feature since students can see when something is due.

### Bad Design
An example of bad design is FirstClass. It has really poor discoverability and its interface is the opposite of intuitive. Additionally, it is almost impossible to get notifications from the FirstClass app, which means that you have to constantly check the app to stay on top of your emails. Finally, emails delete on FirstClass after thirty days without any warning so it is easy to lose important emails that you forgot were important.
