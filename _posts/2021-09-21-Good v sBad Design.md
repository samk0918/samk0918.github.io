## Good vs. Bad Design

### Good Design
An example of good design is the Google Classroom website. Google Classroom is well designed because it gives good feedback. In the instant between when you click on a class and the class pages loads, there is a little bar at the top of the screen that fills up as the class loads so you know that the class is loading and the website has registered your request. Additionally, the discoverability of Google Classroom is excellent since it is easy to click on things and figure out the different tools available to you. Of course, some of the design of Google Classroom is up to the teacher, and that modification is another element of its good design. The option to put something as a material or an assignment is another helpful feature since students can see when something is due.
